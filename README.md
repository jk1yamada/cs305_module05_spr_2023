NAU CS305 Module 05 Submission Repository for Section 001 Spring 2023



This is a repository for a simple web-based game I am creating for CS212.
The project involves dynamically generating a table of white squares in HTML using Javascript, and choosing a random number between 1-10 inclusive of squares to change to black as the starting configuration of the game.
This game is a replication of "Lights Out", where the goal is to cause all 25 squares in the 5x5 grid to change to white by clicking squares, which causes them to flip their state - as well as those of adjacent squares - from black to white or vice versa.

TODO: Verify win condition check is working properly</br>
TODO: Declare a set of solveable puzzles? Not sure if this is required for the assignment.</br>
TODO: Show a page alert when the game is completed.</br>

This project uses the GPL license, which allows for this project to be released as open source and available to be collaborated on by other Github users including the collaborators declared for this project.

## Proposed addition to game is adding traps and bonuses. Take it or leave it. It is your game. Sounds like a cool project.
